When you're faced with a problem statement, the order of thinking should generally be:

1. Is it even a data problem?
First check: Can this be solved just with rules, heuristics, or simple automation?

If yes → you don't need AI or ML.

Example: "Send a notification if stock < threshold" → basic logic, no ML needed.

2. Do we have (or can we get) enough good quality data?
No data → no ML.

If data is missing or messy, first Data Engineering is needed:

Collect

Clean

Organize (databases, pipelines, ETL)

3. Can it be solved by traditional analytics or simple statistics?
Sometimes simple descriptive stats (averages, trends) can answer the question.

If so → no ML needed (yet).

4. Does the problem need prediction, pattern finding, or automation at scale?
If YES → it’s an ML or AI problem.

Now you choose:

ML if you're making predictions, classifications, recommendations, etc.

AI (like GenAI) if you need creativity, generation, conversation, etc.

So the order in your head should be:
✅ Is it a real data problem?
✅ Is the data ready? (Data Engineering?)
✅ Can simple rules/statistics solve it?
✅ If not, go for ML/AI.

Summary line to remember:

Data Engineering before ML. ML before AI. Simplicity before complexity.


Let me give you real-world examples where people mistakenly use AI instead of ML:

1. Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to Predict Structured Data
Mistake: "Let's use ChatGPT to predict customer churn."

Problem: Predicting churn is a structured ML task (classification: "stay" vs "leave"), NOT a natural language task.

Better: Use a simple logistic regression, random forest, or XGBoost model.

Why: Faster, cheaper, more interpretable, and more accurate.

2. Using AI to Categorize Very Simple Things
Mistake: "We'll use an AI agent to categorize products into electronics, fashion, etc."

Problem: This is a simple multi-class classification problem.

Better: Train a simple ML model on labeled product features (name, description, price).

Why: AI models (like GPT) are overkill, expensive, and harder to control.

3. Training AI for Search when Search Ranking Works
Mistake: "We need an AI to answer product questions in our search bar."

Problem: Many search needs can be handled with simple text ranking, vector search, or keyword search with ML tuning.

Better: Enhance search with semantic embeddings + basic ranking model first.

4. Trying to Generate Output When Retrieval is Enough
Mistake: "Let's build an AI chatbot that answers HR policies questions."

Problem: Most companies already have documents or knowledge bases.

Better: Use a retrieval-augmented search (like a FAQ bot) first — don't generate answers until you really need it.

5. Using AI without Enough Data
Mistake: "We'll fine-tune a big AI model to personalize product recommendations."

Problem: Fine-tuning or custom AI requires lots of clean, labeled data.

Better: Start with simple collaborative filtering (classic recommender systems) or small ML models first.

Core reasons people make this mistake:

Examples where AI was problem :-

1. A Retail Company Tried to Use a Custom LLM for Product Recommendations
What they did: Spent months fine-tuning a GPT-like model to recommend clothes.

What happened:

The model hallucinated (suggested "blue jeans" for a user searching for "winter jackets").

Cost $30k+ in compute for training and infra.

It still performed worse than their old basic collaborative filtering model.

Lesson: Structured behavior (clicks, purchases) → classic ML wins easily.

2. A Health Startup Tried to Use GPT to Predict Disease Risk
What they did: Used GPT-3 prompts to "guess" disease likelihood from patient structured data.

What happened:

Predictions were random.

Doctors didn't trust it because there was no explanation.

Regulators rejected the product.

Lesson: Risk prediction on patient data = ML classification/regression problem, not language generation.

3. A Tech Company Made a "Smart Assistant" for Customer Tickets
What they did: Built an expensive AI bot to answer customer support tickets automatically.

What happened:

60% of tickets were simple password reset issues.

Could have been solved with a rule-based bot or a small intent classifier.

AI bot made weird replies → frustrated customers.

Lesson: Simple decision trees + keyword detection would have solved most tickets faster and cheaper.

4. An E-commerce Platform Tried AI for Inventory Management
What they did: Hired a team to build a generative model to predict inventory needs.

What happened:

They ignored historical sales trends.

AI model guessed wrongly and stores overstocked the wrong items.

Lesson: Time series forecasting models like ARIMA or Prophet were enough — no AI needed.

5. A Financial Company Used AI for Document Search (and Regretted It)
What they did: Used GPT-style AI to "search" compliance documents.

What happened:

The AI generated "plausible-sounding" but wrong answers.

In compliance/legal, wrong = massive legal risk.

Lesson: Retrieval-first systems (search the real document, no generation) were the correct safe move.



Reason	What Happens
Hype	"AI sounds cooler" → people jump to AI even if not needed.
Overcomplication	Simple ML is boring, but it often works better.
Misunderstanding	They think AI = better performance (not always true).
Cost blindness	AI costs $$$ (compute + time) compared to small ML models.
Quick rule of thumb for you:
If the input is structured (tables, numbers), think ML first.
If the input is unstructured (text, images, sound), think AI (sometimes).
Always solve with the simplest method that works well enough.

# Prompt 

You are an expert solution architect. 

When given any problem statement, follow this thinking process:
1. Check if the problem can be solved by simple business rules, heuristics, or automation. If yes, suggest that.
2. If not, check if it can be solved by traditional Machine Learning (ML) using structured data (classification, regression, clustering, etc.). If yes, suggest that.
3. If not, check if it requires advanced AI (generative AI, LLMs, computer vision, or other deep learning).
4. Always choose the simplest, most reliable solution first.
5. Explain the decision clearly and briefly.

Now, for the following problem, apply this thinking and suggest the best approach:
