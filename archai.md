# How to Decide Between Rules, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## 🧠 General Thinking Order When Facing a Problem

1. **Is it even a data problem?**  
   - Check: *Can this be solved with simple business rules, heuristics, or automation?*  
   - ✅ If yes → No ML or AI needed.
   - **Example:** "Send a notification if stock < threshold" → basic logic.

2. **Do we have (or can we get) enough good quality data?**  
   - No data → No ML possible.
   - If missing/messy → First do **Data Engineering** (collect, clean, organize).

3. **Can it be solved by traditional analytics or simple statistics?**  
   - Sometimes simple descriptive stats (averages, trends) are enough.
   - ✅ If yes → No ML needed.

4. **Does the problem require prediction, pattern finding, or automation at scale?**  
   - If yes → It's an ML or AI problem.

5. **Choosing between ML and AI:**  
   - Use **ML** if you need *predictions, classifications, recommendations*.
   - Use **AI** (GenAI, LLMs) if you need *creativity, generation, or conversation*.

## 🚫 Common Mistakes: When People Use AI Instead of ML

| # | Mistake | Better Solution | Why? |
|:--|:--------|:-----------------|:-----|
| 1 | Using LLMs to Predict Structured Data (e.g., Customer Churn) | Traditional ML (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) | Cheaper, faster, more accurate, more explainable. |
| 2 | Using AI to Categorize Simple Things (e.g., Product Type) | Multi-class ML classification | Simpler, easier to control, less cost. |
| 3 | Training AI for Search Problems | Search ranking, vector search, keyword matching + ML tuning | Retrieval works better than generation here. |
| 4 | Building AI Chatbots for FAQs | Retrieval-Augmented Search (RAG) or simple FAQ bots | Retrieval-first is safer, faster. |
| 5 | Fine-Tuning AI Models Without Enough Data | Collaborative Filtering / Small ML models | Fine-tuning needs lots of clean labeled data. |

## 📉 Real Examples Where AI Was a Wrong Choice

### 1. Retail Company – Product Recommendations
- **Mistake:** Built custom LLM for recommending clothes.
- **What Happened:** Model hallucinated, $30k wasted, old ML model performed better.
- **Lesson:** Structured behavior → Simple ML wins.

### 2. Health Startup – Disease Prediction
- **Mistake:** Used GPT-3 prompts on structured patient data.
- **What Happened:** Random outputs, no doctor trust, regulator rejection.
- **Lesson:** Predicting health risks = Classic ML classification task.

### 3. Tech Company – Smart Customer Support Bot
- **Mistake:** Built expensive AI chatbot.
- **What Happened:** Most issues were simple (password resets); AI made mistakes.
- **Lesson:** Rules + Intent Classification would have been sufficient.

### 4. E-commerce – Inventory Management
- **Mistake:** Built generative model for stock prediction.
- **What Happened:** Overstocking wrong items.
- **Lesson:** Time series forecasting models like ARIMA/Prophet would have worked.

### 5. Financial Company – Compliance Document Search
- **Mistake:** Used AI to "answer" compliance queries.
- **What Happened:** Wrong/made-up answers → Massive legal risks.
- **Lesson:** Retrieval-first system (searching real documents) is safer.

## ⚠️ Root Causes Why People Make This Mistake

| Reason | What Happens |
|:---|:---|
| Hype | AI sounds cooler → people jump to it. |
| Overcomplication | Simple ML feels boring → people overengineer. |
| Misunderstanding | People wrongly believe AI always performs better. |
| Cost Blindness | They ignore AI’s high compute and infra costs. |

## 📋 Quick Rule of Thumb

- **If input is structured** (tables, numbers) → Start with ML.
- **If input is unstructured** (text, images, sound) → Consider AI (only if needed).
- **Always solve with the simplest method that works well enough.**

# 📜 Master Prompt to Think Through Any Problem

\`\`\`
You are an expert solution architect.

When given any problem statement, follow this thinking process:
1. Check if the problem can be solved by simple business rules, heuristics, or automation. If yes, suggest that.
2. If not, check if it can be solved by traditional Machine Learning (ML) using structured data (classification, regression, clustering, etc.). If yes, suggest that.
3. If not, check if it requires advanced AI (generative AI, LLMs, computer vision, or deep learning).
4. Always choose the simplest, most reliable solution first.
5. Explain the decision clearly and briefly.

Now, for the following problem, apply this thinking and suggest the best approach:
